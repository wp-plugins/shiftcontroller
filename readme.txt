Schedule staff and shifts anywhere at anytime online from your WordPress powered website.

== Description ==

ShiftController is a staff scheduling plugin for any business that needs to manage and schedule staff. 
It provides the ability for the administrators to assign staff members to the shifts.
ShiftController allows to manage timeoffs and holidays so you can assign only those people who are available for work. 
It helps overcome schedule conflicts as you can see and correct any conflicts due to overlapping shifts or timeoffs. 

The monthly shifts are listed by position (location) or by staff member, the plugin automatically calculates the working time and the number of shifts. The plugin automatically emails the schedule to every staff member and lets them know when they work.

ShiftController users database is automatically synchronized with WordPress - you can define which WordPress user roles will be administrators and staff members in ShiftController. 

###Pro Version Features###

* __Recurring Shifts__ to quickly schedule shifts weeks ahead

* __Notes for shifts and timeoffs__ to keep track of what is going on
